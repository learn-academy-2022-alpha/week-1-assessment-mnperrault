# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is open source software that allows a user to make changes to code stored locally, and GitHub is the protocol which allows for local code to be uploaded online for collaborative coding.

  Researched answer: Git is an open source control system that allows the user to manage and keep track of their source code history. GitHub is an online hosting service that enables the user to manage Git repositories.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Relational operators (True/ False) and Logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT) are the JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: Relational operators looks for a relationship between two values. A Boolean value is returned.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index is the location of the item and the value is the measurement of the content that you index in JavaScript arrays.

  Researched answer: Index of an array is an address assigned to array elements. The content of each element in the array is called the value.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:  Iteration is the process of repeating a certain action numerous times until the desired condition is rendered.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the of executing a particular action a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques involve to primary roles which are that of the driver (person typing the code) and the navigator (person overseeing the code and constantly scanning for errors in syntax). In order for both users in the the pair to be fully engaged in the pair programming, it's recommended that both users alternate roles every 10 to 20 minutes and take frequent breaks.

  Researched answer: Proper pair programming procedure involves two programmers working together at one workstation. One programmer has the role of the driver who writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles often.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher Order Functions are functions that operator on other functions by returning them or rendering them as arguments.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework in JavaScript created to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: Objects in JavaScript are containers for named values.

4. Method: A method is the action that can be performed on and object.

5. Classes: Classes are templates for creating objects, and are created with the same syntax as object methods.
